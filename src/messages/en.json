    "liaDescription": "LIA was an important part of the education where I gained practical experience within the industry.

When the work was done, we wrote a final report reflecting on the process, the challenges we faced, and how we solved them.",
    "thesisDesc3": "I chose to work on a project involving building a responsive web application focusing on user experience and accessibility with a clear target audience. During the thesis, I had the opportunity to use the latest technologies and tools in web development, including React and TypeScript.",
